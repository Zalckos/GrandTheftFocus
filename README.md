# Grand Theft Focus
Extension for the [GNOME Desktop Environment](https://www.gnome.org/). 

This removes the annoying "Windows is Ready" notification and brings the window into focus instead.

Inspired by [Steal My Focus](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/234/steal-my-focus/).

(Tested using Manjaro with GNOME 42.4)
